# Rain Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a Rain Prediction Project using machine learning techniques. The project aims to predict rain based on meteorological data, utilizing numerical features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

## Key Features

1. **Feature Selection and Engineering:**
   - Use relevant meteorological data as numerical features.
   - Apply feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.

2. **Model Selection and Tuning:**
   - Implement machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting).
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.

3. **Data Preprocessing and Validation:**
   - Handle missing data and outliers.
   - Employ k-fold cross-validation to assess model generalization.

## Skills Required

- Machine learning algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation metrics
- Python programming
- Data preprocessing
- Validation techniques
- Proficiency in Pandas and scikit-learn libraries

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
